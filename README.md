# Convious Assignment

## High level test plan

1. Baseic CRUD tests for all Restaurants APIs
   - Starting with "happy flow" tests
   - Then leading to negative tests, such as:
     - Create restaurant API without `name`
     - Create restaurant API with already existing restaurant (same and different name case, for example: 'My Res' and 'my RES' are the same)
     - Delete/Update non-existing restaurant
2. Basic tests for Polls APIs
   - Again, starting with "happy flow" tests
